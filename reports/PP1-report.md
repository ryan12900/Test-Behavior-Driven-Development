# Naming and Organizational Details

**Language: Python**

**Testing framework: Pytest**

Since we selected Python as our programming language, we decided to use Python's naming convention for functions and named all the tests with lowercase words with words seperated by underscores.

Each of the 5 functions have their own testing suite in seperate files, the test files are named the same as the function that they are testing with "_pytest" added to the end of it. The application itself, along with all the defined functions, are contained within one file.

The individual tests themselves are named using Python's conventions and describe what the test is testing for.

# Source Management Approach

Our group used the Github Flow source management approach to complete the application.

In order to not have any code conflicts and complications, each group member worked on their own branch while implementing their changes. This allowed everyone to work on their own functions without being affected by the changes of another team member.

This approach also allowed us to make sure that anything on the 'main' branch is readily deployable and working.

Finally, this approach allowed our team members to freely experiment on their own branch when implementing their code, and made sure each of our code was reviewed by another member before being merged to the 'main' branch.
