# Naming and Organizational Details

**Language: Python**

**Testing framework: Pytest**

Since we selected Python as our programming language, we decided to use Python's naming convention for functions and named all the tests with lowercase words with words seperated by underscores.

Each of the 5 functions have their own testing suite in seperate files, the test files are named the same as the function that they are testing with "_pytest" added to the end of it.

The individual tests themselves are named using Python's conventions and describe what the test is testing for.
